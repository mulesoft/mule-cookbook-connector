## Cookbook Anypoint&trade; Connector

The Cookbook is a service that helps users organize ingredients and recipes to easily find recipes for the foods they would like to prepare.

This API allows users to use the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for single and multiple recipes and ingredients. The API also allows you to view recently added recipes.
