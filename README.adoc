= Mule Cookbook Tutorial

*Cookbook* is a service that helps users organize ingredients and recipes, so users can easily maintain recipes for the foods they like to prepare.

The purpose of this service is to help you learn the features provided by Anypoint Connector DevKit and to provide guidelines for connector development using DevKit.

This project contains various client modules that expose the Cookbook service, which
can be used as reference for development of SOAP, REST, or Java SDK-based Connectors.

The cookbook-connector module showcases the use of DevKit in building an *SDK-based* connector.

This project also has a basic server implementation, so you can test the connector while you develop. For detailed Documentation refer to link:http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-cookbook-tutorial/[Cookbook Tutorial]
